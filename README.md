#  Android XMRig Miner

XMRig miner built inside an android app

This app is based on the proof of concept provided by https://github.com/upost/MoneroMiner

I updated dependencies (libuv-1.23.1 and xmrig-2.8.0-rc) and the project to Android Studio 3.2.

Otherwise, you can download the app directly from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/ElijaxApps-org/android-xmrig-miner/releases)

# Compile instructions
Clone the repository and run the following command on base dir:

Then you can sign your .apk in order to install it (release builds must be digital signed before install).
